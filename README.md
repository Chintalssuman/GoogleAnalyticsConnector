# GoogleAnalyticsConnector
Custom connector for google analytics in Power BI


Disclaimers:

1. I made this custom connector for personal use, so it is not a full developed/ full functioning one. Use at your own risk ;)
2. The Google Analytics API limits are still there:
    50,000 requests per project per day, which can be increased. 10 queries per second (QPS) per IP address. In the API Console, there is a similar quota referred to as Requests per 100 seconds per user.

3.Not all the Google Analytics parameters are available (due to point 1.) but can be easily added.

4.You need to create your own project in the Google developer console to make this work.
